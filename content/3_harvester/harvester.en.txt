  heading: "what's happening here?"
  paragraph: 'Welcome, you are about to make art! In the next few minutes you can help us to be creative. Creativity needs a foundation, an inspiration. And we want to create this foundation here. The Mixing Senses-Harvester is a friendly data collection tool. We let you hear and see things - and you can tell us how you feel about them. You do this by choosing a colour value or writing a suitable word. Later, these inputs will result in a database that we can use for visualisation in various forms (alienating, inspiring, shocking, fascinating, ...?). During our exhibition we show our results in exciting artworks. Yeah!'

  heading: what is vi•son?
  paragraph: 'vi•son is an audioreactive digital art performance. In the project we focus on various phenomena related to multisensory perception. We are especially interested in music. Music is a common way to encode and communicate emotions and moods. In this translation, however, information is lost, aspects are accentuated, others are neglected. The multidimensional emotions are limited by music to one aspect - the auditory level. Among other things, we want to try to unfold the one-dimensional code of music again. We want to experience what people imagine, think, do, see and feel when they hear something specific - and vice versa. At the crossway between creative coding, electronic music and social sciences, we want to explore aesthetic, inspiring and multi-sensory ways of representing sound and emotion. If you use this tool, you can support us on this journey.'

  paragraph: 'vi•son is a cooperation project between KALANGU and Pendeloque. KALANGU is an artist pseudonym under which mainly musical projects are developed. The light art group Pendeloque occupies itself with light in spaces and the combination of light art with other forms of expression such as theatre, music, dance and media installations.

  heading: how to use the harvester
  paragraph: |
    We have tried to keep the harvester as simple as possible. At first, it's probably best to try to playfully explore how the tool works. Don't worry - there are no "wrong" answers. The experience is divided into scenes. Each scene contains a triggering example and a little task for you, for example a colour selection. For the colour selection can manipulate four different values with the big knobs. For the feeling selection we have added some options that others think describe the trigger well. The other tasks can also be manipulated by clicking and dragging. You confirm by clicking on the button. When a small fact text appears, the input is saved. Great! You can use the harvester for as long as you want - but at some point you will encounter examples that seem familiar, cause we have only added a finite number of them.

  heading: "what's in it for me?"
  paragraph: >
    You will learn, reflect and do something
    good! Because first of all you will help
    an independent, non-commercial art
    project with your entries. Secondly, we
    believe that the examination of your own
    perception can create a moment of peace
    and meditation in the hustle and bustle
    of everyday life. Third, you can learn
    more details about digital
    representation, music theory and
    multi-sensory perception because we have
    researched some heuristics, examples and
    facts that we will show you after each
    scene.

  heading: "what if I don't know what to do?"
  paragraph: 'Try to proceed intuitively - what is your mood right now? Are you feeling well? Are you annoyed by a sound, a question or the noise from the construction site next door? Now move a slider with the mouse and stop at the point where a colour seems to match your current mood. You can close your eyes and imagine a place where the sound will take you. What is the dominant colour? Try not to think in words, but in moods, places and shapes.'
